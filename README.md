Restaurant Rating Prediction

📌 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and predict restaurant ratings based on various features such as location, cuisine type, and customer votes. We explore different regression models to build a predictive system and analyze customer preferences regarding restaurant cuisines.

🚀 Features

Predict restaurant ratings using regression models.

Analyze the impact of cuisine type on ratings.

Identify the most popular cuisines based on customer votes.

Visualize data to understand rating distributions and relationships between features.

📊 Datasets

The dataset contains restaurant information, including:

Restaurant Name, Address, City, and Country

Cuisine Type

Average Cost for Two

Online Delivery Availability

Aggregate Rating & Votes

Price Range, and more.

🛠 Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Machine Learning (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Ridge & Lasso Regression)

📈 Models Used

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Ridge Regression

Lasso Regression

📊 Data Visualization

We used different types of visualizations to extract insights:

Histograms for rating distribution

Bar plots for average rating per cuisine

Scatter plots to understand relationships between features

🔍 Key Insights

Certain cuisines receive higher ratings on average.

The number of votes correlates with ratings.

Some cities have higher-rated restaurants on average.
